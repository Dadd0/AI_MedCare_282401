## Assignments 
1. Perform an Explanatory data analysis (EDA) with visualization.
2. Generate a training and test set. The test set should be used only at the end. Your goal is to estimate an individual's “Physical Health” feature
3. Preprocess the dataset (remove outliers, encode categorical features with one hot encoding, not necessarily in this order)
4. Define whether this is a regression, classification or clustering problem, explain why and  choose your model design accordingly. Test at least 3 different models. First, create a validation set from the training set to analyze the behaviour with the default hyperparameters.Then use cross-validation to find the best set of hyperparameters. You must describe every hyperparameter tuned (the more, the better)
5. Select the best architecture using the right metric
6. Compute the performances of the test set
7. Explain your findings
